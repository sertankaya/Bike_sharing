Udacity Nano-degree - Bike Sharing using traditional Neural Network (Fully Connected Neural Network)

In this project, I get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. I also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!
